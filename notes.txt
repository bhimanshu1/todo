# To Do List
1) get request => to get the task
2) post request => to post a new task
3) put request => to edit the task
4) delete request => to delete the task

//
get("api/v1/items") => to get all the task
post("api/v2/items") => add a new task
delete("api/v1/items/:id") => to delete a particular task
//

? now Why do we have this type of the notations like all are  similar here 
@ this is an convention, that we should follow to while creating an rest api
   and the other reasons could be that on the server you might be hosting multiple 
   api's or other applications, so to provide isolation and consistency

//
to maintain the readability we can create routers for specific 
context in different files and import them
like for the amazon
there could routes specific to users
there could be routes specific to orders
there could be routes specific to products
routes for shirts... many more
so all the routes of all types in one file can clutter
the file
so, for each context of routers we create each file, 
where each file contains all the routers related to that context

//
so we learnt that:
context based route storing
all the routes related to dresses in one file
and also the specific route handlers are also stored in the another file
we create routes in one file, create route handler functions in another file
import the route handler functions into the routes, then use those imported functions as callbacks

//
.gitignore file is used to ignore the files and folders that
we do not want to track
# .file_name -> ignores file_name
# folder_name -> ignores folder_name
